# StateWise-analysis-of-M.Tech-students-at-IIITD

This is a small project about state wise analysis of students for M.Tech 2020-2022 session at IIIT Delhi. This idea/mini-project was given as a fun activity/assignment in our Induction session by Prof.Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Dean of Student Affairs at IIIT Delhi.

The mini-project includes the use of geopandas python library and choropleth map. (Wikipedia: A choropleth map is a type of thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to a statistical variable that represents an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic within each area, such as population density or per-capita income.)
